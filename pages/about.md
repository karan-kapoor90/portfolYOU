# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Karan**,<br>

I'm a Technology Evangelist who loves riding the global technology wave. There's so much to learn, to read and play with that I find myself tinkering with something or the other whenver I can. In my free time though, I love reading, spending quality time with family, watching movies and discovering music.

Outside the realm of technology - business, finance and investment interest me. I'm also an avid watch enthusiast and a Space nerd.

I typically work in areas concerning 
* Integration 
* API Management and Monitization
* Service orchestration using Service-Oriented-Architecture for enterprise solutions 
* Microservices and Serverless computing
* Docker and Kubernetes
* Hyperledger Fabric 
* Full stack web technology
